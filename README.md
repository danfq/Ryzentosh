![alt text](https://github.com/danfq/Ryzentosh-Sonoma/blob/main/Screenshots/system.png?raw=true)

After quite a lot of tweaks, twists and turns, I finally made my Build 100% functional.

If you have the same Build, check out the `Releases` Page to get the EFI.<br>
Don't forget to generate your own `SMBIOS` and replace it via `ProperTree`.

To get as much Performance as you can out of your Ryzentosh, with these specifications, I suggest you use `MacPro7,1`.

## Build Specifications

## What Works

<b>Everything!</b>

I've tested all `iServices` and ran benchmarks - no issues to report.

### GPU

Sometimes, `GPU Monitor Pro` will report a wrong value for "Current Free Video Memory", while there are actually 8GB in total.

Most of the time, this can be "fixed" by rebooting.

\* This GPU <b>MUST</b> be flashed, before attempting to use it in MacOS.<br>
Make sure to follow the steps in the `GPU Preparations` folder.
