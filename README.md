This Repo holds my personal Ryzentosh OC EFI, based on `OpenCore 1.0.6`, running [macOS Tahoe](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/06/macos-tahoe-26-makes-the-mac-more-capable-productive-and-intelligent-than-ever/).<br>

If you have the same Build, check out the `Releases` Page to get the EFI.<br>
Don't forget to generate your own `SMBios` and replace it via `ProperTree`.

To get as much Performance as you can out of your Ryzentosh, with these specifications, I suggest you use `MacPro7,1`.
