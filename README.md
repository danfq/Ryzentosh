After quite a lot of tweaks, twists and turns, I finally made my Build 100% functional.

If you have the same Build, check out the `Releases` Page to get the EFI.<br>
Don't forget to generate your own `SMBios` and replace it via `ProperTree`.

To get as much Performance as you can out of your Ryzentosh, with these specifications, I suggest you use `iMac20,1`.

## What Works

<b>Everything!</b>

I've tested all `iServices` and ran benchmarks - no issues to report.

Check `AMD Patches`, `GPU`, `Sleep` & `Virtualization` to fix their respective issues.
